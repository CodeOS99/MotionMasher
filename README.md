# MotionMasher
Motion Masher is an incremental-esque game, where your motion is used to mash enemies.

## How to play
Open and close your hand on a button in order to enter through it

At the start of the main scene and the main menu scene, you will have a few seconds of cooldown, to prevent accidental button presses

The main gameplay revolves around fighting small circles. They have varying health, which can in turn be reduce by you damage.

There are two kinds of attacks:

### Passive Attack

Just hold down and hover over circles. This deals less damage, and gives less money. Furthermore, there is a cooldown to how fast you cna perform a passive attack.

### Active Attack

Activaly open and close you hands on circles. Provides extra money, more damage, and no cooldown.

Hitting each circle awards money, which may be spent at the shop.
Circles also contribute to the total enemy power, which may be seen represented as a red translucent overlay, covering the screen.

The training zone is there to help you train, and also gives a small boost to your stats.

Be very careful in the shop! There is a 0.5s cooldown on purchasing anythign from the shop, and you also need to very carefully and slowly close and open your hands in order to confirm your purchase.

Click on any of the 'Quit' buttons on the screen, or press q to close the game.
